 * This class defines a mass in the model that carries with it an associated

 * <p/>
 * IMPORTANT: All images used by this class are assumed to have their center of
 * mass in the horizontal direction in the center of the image.  In order to
 * make this work for an image, it may be necessary to have some blank
 * transparent space on one side.
